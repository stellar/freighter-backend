Relies on a Redis instance when `MODE=production`, you can either run `docker compose up` to use docker to stand up a Redis or you can start one on the configured port manually. If you're running in development mode, it uses a memory store instead.

## Setup

To install dependencies, run `yarn i`

## Development

Start development server -
`yarn start`

CLI arguments
-e | --env: (optional) Overrides the environment variable set for `MODE`, should be set to `development|production`
-p | --port: (optional) Sets the application port adn defaults to `3002`

## Production Build

`yarn build:prod`

## Testing

Run unit tests with `yarn test`.

## Mercury Integrity Test

In order to test Mercury for data integrity against Horizon, you can configure your env to `USE_MERCURY=true && MODE=production`.
This will result in a worker that continously processes new blocks, queries both Mercury and Horizon for the same transaction, transforms both responses into a common schema, and finally checks for correctness of the results.

In case of an integrity failure, the `USE_MERCURY` redis flag will be flipped to false and the application will fallback to serving requests from Horizon/Rpc.

## Metrics

Metrics are gathered using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), and a standalone metrics server runs on the standard Prometheus port and exposes a `/metrics` route for collection.
